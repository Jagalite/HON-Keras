I'm going to be 26 this fall, live in Florida (Finally lol) and recently divorced. I'm not the kind of woman who's personality fits into a cookie cutter like most women in this country. I like bein' who I am, and if ya can't handle that, look else where. ;-) I enjoy being a unqiue person and not someone that fits into society's 'norm'. I don't always take the path of least resistance and I'm both free spirited and free willed. I'm very outgoing-I talk to just about everyone, enjoy trying out new things, very active, sweet 'most' of the time. :-) I enjoy learning about people and culture, everything in my place actually comes from different countries (Think of it like walking into Pier1 or the World Market store). I'm only looking to talk to guys between the ages of 24-34, no one older or younger please.  If ya wanna meet me or just wanna chitchat, send me a message! You can also check out my keywords to get any idea of who I am before you message me :) Hope to hear from you!
