I am fun loving and energetic, love animals and to hang out with friends. I will be attending college soon. I am looking for something serious now. I don't drink, don't do drungs and don't party. I'm laid back and easy going and like a good sense of humor. I am purly SINGLE now, no previous attachments or strings in my life. I don't ask questions I don't truly want the answer to. All and any questions are welcome, but I don't promise an answer; because just like everyone else, i have the right to my privacy. I'm faithful to my word and in relationships and only want the truth from a guy. I like to meet new people and try new things. So don't be affraid ;) i promise not to bite to hard ;)
