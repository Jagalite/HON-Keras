Hello. How'bout that ride in...
My name is Ellen- I'm 23, from Minneapolis area. I moved to Eau Claire Wisconsin in 2006. I'm a theater major and I love everything. Literally. 
I Love harleys, camping, fishing, rollercoasters &amp; carnivals, snowmobiling, horses- (actually all animals...), beer-wine &amp; whiskey, and like I said- everything. I listen to every genre of music ranging from Avenged Sevenfold- to Michael Buble- to Tim McGraw. Love me a man with some tattoos- but not a must. 
I can be annoyingly outgoing and crazy...but again- love that too. Recently single (by choice!!) and looking for a pick-me-up baby!
Hope you are having a spectacular day! Lets see what happens...
