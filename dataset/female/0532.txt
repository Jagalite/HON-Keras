I enjoy the simple things in life: friends, family, good times and laughter. Preferably all together, and having a good drink in hand usually doesn't hurt either!! My dog, Jack, is very important to me! I am fun, friendly, outgoing, loyal, honest, dependable; all the good stuff!! I am close to my family! Having a good time is generally very easy for me, and is usually made easier with the right company!
