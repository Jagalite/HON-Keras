I'm just a simple girl who enjoys spending time with my family and friends -- they mean the world to me! I'm currently single with no children. I work as a Pediatric Nurse and enjoy making a difference in someone else's life.  I admire  anything &quot;vintage&quot;, including the 1940's era, pin-up's, antiques and old boxing and mafia related material. I'm also fascinated by old freight trains and sailboats, as well.  Hiking, camping, and pretty much anything outdoor related peaks my interest, too. I'm not necessarily on here to meet anyone, but if the right opportunity presents itself, well... one shall see. :)
