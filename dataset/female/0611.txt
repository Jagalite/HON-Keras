If you're going to message me thinking that I'll be easy read this: I'd rather be called beautiful, than be called hot. I won't get down on my knees just to have a boyfriend, I respect myself more than that. Holding hands gives me the same enjoyment as other activites do. We can sleep in the same bed without having sex. I'm scared to put my heart on the line again, it's been crushed too many times before. I'm tired of showing how much I care, and getting nothing back. I don't want a guy that's going to play with my emotions... I want someone who genuinely cares. I want words backed up with actions. I won't sleep with you on the first, second, third, or fourth date, or even before I feel comfortable, if this bothers you, then just leave me alone. I want someone who can respect me. I love my friends, I hate 2 faced people, I love being with the one I care about, I hate being bored, I hate being afraid to let people know how I feel. So, I'm happy with my life right now, for the most part.
