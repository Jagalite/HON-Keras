Hi I'm Kara. I live in Las Vegas but I'm a flight attendant so I travel all over the world. I'm hoping my profile proves that older women can be hot too ! ;-)

I think most of us grow up with a lot of fear - &quot;what will people think of me if I do this?&quot; etc... and that's sad - we should all be fearless about our dreams. I tend to relate best to people who are just upfront and honest about what they want.

My ideal guy is strong, brave and confident, likes to have fun &amp; be casual. If a guy really wants to take a girl out I believe he makes it happen.

Life is short - you owe it to yourself and others to do something wild &amp; outrageous every day. Something that makes you smile and makes your heart beat faster... something that surprises others and helps them get outside their own box in some way... carpe diem !!!

LIFE IS NOT ABOUT WAITING FOR THE STORM TO PASS... IT’S ABOUT DANCING IN THE RAIN...
