About me...oh where do i start, I have had a very log short life.....my son is my world...you date me you take him as well....I just like to have fun not really very picky...never anything wrong with cracking open a beer in the open water with a good friend....I do school online trying to further my education...wish i could just work from home....I hate the city....though i was born in the city....i feel as if i have found myself out here in the country where i can be a hard worker and a wonderful mother! I love to listen to music pretty much anything you can dance around the house to!
