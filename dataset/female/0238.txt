Actress, ex-stewardess, ex-model.  Just want to see what my score will be and, of course, to hear what you think!

I will chat but not meet, as I'm well-catered for on the personal front.

I like to think I have high standards so if you can't spell, use props like guns, cars or children or don't appear to own a shirt it's very unlikely I'll reply to you.

As to that, it's really pointless matching me if you aren't star members.  If you can't afford or you're too mean to take out a membership why do you think I can be bothered to chase you up?

lol
