Hey ok so I guess I'm going to have to change my about me...I'm Natasha and I'm 23 which im sure you can see from up above. I am an Assistant Manager at a Dollar General been there almost two years. Getting a certificate in Business Managment when that is up I'm going for a degree in Radiology. I live in a house by myself that I rent. I do not play games. I am not interested in guys that think theyre Gods gift to women, someone just out of a relationship, someone that doesn't know what they want, someone that wants a girl to be their crutch to pay their bills, and definetly not someone looking for a friends with benefits. I enjoy karaoke, church, being with my family and hanging out with  my friends doing a lot of random things. I am a very independent girl and I want to be treated with the right amount of respect which is far and few between on this website.
