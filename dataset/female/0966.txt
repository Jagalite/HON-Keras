It is hard to describe myself... I love many different things in life,  walking, reading ( i prefer to spend my free time with an interesting book than with a big group people, i am introverted). I am interested in christian literature very much ( it is my passion) and philosophy, i just enjoy it. It would be great to find a person with the same interests.
