I'm Britonny.I'm 22.I have two kids.I love tattoos and piercings.I have 23 piercings and 7 tattoos.I love music of all types.I love to spend time with my family and when I have the time I like to hang with my friends as well.I'm a very honest person and I hate liars.I can be a little out spoken at times.I'm not like most girls.I also don't care what anyone says/thinks about me.I do have a busy life and would like to meet someone who can handle the crazy life I have.I would like to meet someone caring,sensitive and understanding.Someone who isn't just good to me but good to my kids as well.Someone who is okay with the fact that no matter what my kids will always come first.Haha I don't even think there are men like that out there..Well,I guess thats all I've got to say for now.
