Hello! I am a southern girl that hails from Texas and currently residing in Seoul as an Elementary teacher. I travel A LOT! I have been to almost 20 countries in less than 2 years and I'm not done yet. I recently got back from Europe and it was amazing! 

I would like to meet some new friends while I am in Korea. I am open-minded and up to doing anything fun, challenging &amp; learning something new, especially about other cultures. I also love eating different kinds of food from other countries!

I am NOT interested in relationships or marriage. I just want to meet new friends for the duration that I am here in Korea. I honestly don’t know how long I will be here so I don’t want anything serious. If you can respect that then let’s start a beautiful friendship together!
