I am 100% Polish and was born in Poland.  Came here, to the States in '89. Been living here ever since.  I have been single for a year and a half now.  It does get lonely-- especially after just getting out of a 5-year relationship.  I am not looking to rush into another relationship, however.  I am just looking for friendship at the moment.  Maybe the friendship can grow into something deeper, who knows?  I'm just tired of dishonest men and players-- men who lie and cheat and are just up to no good.  If you think you can win me over and/ or are interested in getting to know me, then holla! Peace.
