I'm 29, single, and work as a veterinary assistant; love the job, love animals. Prefer dogs and snakes. Am rather bored in this frozen north so feel free to say hi. Oh yeah, and I do read the profiles, so please take the time to enter one, or I probly won't respond. Have made some great friends and would like to keep doing so. Can never have to many friends right? (:
