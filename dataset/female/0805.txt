Hey ya'll, :) I'm 27 yrs old, a leo and I love making new friends!  I love dancing, partying, kareoke, hiking, caving, camping, river floats, theater, opera, bar hopping with friends, shopping, movies (especially bad horror movies), cooking, games (of all kinds, video, board, card etc).  I am in Siloam Springs but am looking for friends in all surrounding areas... and when I say friends I mean I want people to actually hang out with... If we match and I don't hear from you pretty soon, we won't stay matched for long... Oh and we should go ahead and get it out of the way that I am a transgender :)  Hope ya'll can deal with that :P  If you wanna hang out send me an email and lets chat... Oh yeah and if you live outside my state, don't even bother clicking yes because I'll click no!  I'm looking for friends to MEET me NOT just MATCH with me... Thnks!!!
