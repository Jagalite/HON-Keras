Relocated to Texas from NC and ended up not quite bonding the the Lone Star state, soooo, am in the process of relocating back to the Triangle area.  I'm an NP (working on my PhD).  I love to run (can you keep up?). Playing with my dog and spend time on the water are two of my favorite things. White chocolate mocha's rank pretty high on the list too. :)  Not looking for anything other than new friends.
