Music is my life.

I used to play cards with my goldfish until he beat me... then I flushed him down the toilet... I shouldn't have named him Einstein...

I'm just looking for people that are as awesome as I am (don't worry I'm not actually conceited) I love laughing, seriously; I even wrote a paper on laughter for school once.

And seriously, no old and/or creepy guys, I really don't need to deal with all that stuff right now. Oh and if you say yes to me it's up to you to send the first message.
