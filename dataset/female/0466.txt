I have Mossy Oak camouflage next to my sorority letters and a Texas Longhorns pocket knife in my Coach bag. I guess you could say I'm a mix of country and class.

I enjoy fourwheeling, fishing, camping, and riding around in big diesel trucks :)

My type of man is one who can fix a flat tire and can mow his own lawn. I tend to go for guys who fish, hunt, fight, and say &quot;yes ma'am,&quot; and &quot;y'all.&quot;

You can FORD a stream, and you can DODGE a stream, but a Chevy will just sink 'like a rock.'&quot; ;)
