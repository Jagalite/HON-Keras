Lisa, early 50s, 3 wonderful children -- none are teenagers any more.  Poems, singing in the rain, mountain views -- these are some of my favorite things.  I am happily married.   I put my picture up to prove to my spouse that I haven't deteriorated too much!  Plus, I do like affirmation from others.:).  Would love to make new female friends -- thanks guys for asking, but I won't stray.
