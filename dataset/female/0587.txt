My name is Julia...born and raised in Germany...Bavaria to be exact...27 yo, 5'6''.....I'm always up for meeting new people and making new friends to either party or just have a coffee with, I think it's quite exciting and keeps things spontaneous in life!
Unfortunately I'm back in Munich from my vacation in the US. Had a blast but now it's OKTOBERFEST time in Munich!!! YAY! Let me know if you're up for a Mass! :-)
