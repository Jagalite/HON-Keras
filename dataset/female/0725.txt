I'm not here for jack squat.  I like chatting with people and that is as far as it will go any more.  If you want someone to talk to then we are good to go.  But as far as meeting, hanging out, or more I am so over it.  You will more than likely never meet me, you will never get to sleep with me, so if that is the intention keep stepping.  I have had it up to my ears with the little &quot;men&quot; that want to front and bs you until they get what they want and then they walk away.  So, if you are after that, really don't bother.  I'm done with the whole internet meet and hook up thing.
