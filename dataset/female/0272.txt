I joined this site because it's fun, but I have met a lot of great people. I have met some of the not so great ones too, so I had to update my info.
     First and foremost I am a single mother of 2 girls that are my life. They are 11 &amp; 13. I am also a full time student, so this web site is not a priority for me. If your life revolves around this site, your computer screen, or your TV screen, you may want to click NEXT.
     I am very down to Earth and love meeting new people as long as they are honest, genuine, and hate drama as much as I do! I love to laugh and I am a nerd. I love to read and can be a big kid at times and want to enjoy life to the fullest and have no regrets. 
     I do NOT care about anything in your pants. From your big wallet, to your big ego. If you can't get close to me on any other level, you will never get close enough for me to know about what's in your pants! Not interested in hooking up online or off, so if that's what's on your mind, click NEXT.
