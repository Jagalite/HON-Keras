I may not be a 10, but I clean up good.

I'm just your average nerdy art girl. If you want to know just how nerdy I am, well you'll just have to find that out on your own. (But I'll give you a hint: I'd love to visit Endor. ;P)  I'm married, so I'm down for just friends. :) If you're going to click yes to meet me, then talk to me. If you don't talk to me, I'll delete you. And if you talk nasty to me, I'll delete you.
