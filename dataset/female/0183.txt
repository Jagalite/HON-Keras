Hey i'm 24 years old. I love the outdoors, am very laid back, and a probably the biggest redneck chick ever! I love to have fun, hang out, take spontaneous roadtrips/adventures, go muddin, 4 wheelin' and fishin', and of course drink! Do not be fooled, this is one chick who can hold her liquor very well. I just got out of th USAF a few months ago and recently moved to a new job in high point, north carolina. i can't change my location in my profile so, I AM NOT IN TUCSON! :)
