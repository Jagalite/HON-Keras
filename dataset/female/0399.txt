My Introduction:
My name is Brandy. I am 28 years old I have very little tolerance for bs or being treated badly. I will put you in your place. I'm a Gemini, if you want to know more about me ask. I'm artsy, creative and kind unless you cross me. If you expect to be treated nicely then approach me in the same manner. I have more balls then most of the men I know and they would tell you the same. 
I currently attend college full time working on my AA degree. From there I will likely go into an Art Degree..and from there a Master of Arts in Library Science. I'd love to hear from you if you read allthat
