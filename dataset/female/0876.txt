&quot;I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself. -DHL&quot; I love playing my guitar, writing songs and drinking sweet tea:) I can throw a football better then a lot of guys, I surf not because mtv says it cool but because I'm dang good at it;) lol I love laughter &amp; kindness!! You wont find me in clubs or other over rated social pits I live way too healthy for that. Nature is the greatest thing on earth! Followed closely by food, football and love:D If your going to friend up with me PLEASE have a kindness in your heart, laughter in your eyes and depth to your soul:D Cheers!
