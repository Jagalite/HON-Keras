I'm 26 5'9, from Mandeville,LA. I'm studying to take my nursing boards so I can get my license. I have no kids, just a chihuahua/daschund named Wendy...she's so precious. I enjoy going to movies, hanging out w/friends, listening to music, video games, sports, love being in the water during the summer. I have 2 tats and will hopefully get a third soon. 
I'm tired of all the games, so if ur just here looking for something physical, I'm not for u. Anything else u wanna know...just ask.
