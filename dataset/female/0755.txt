I go to Central Michigan University and I am double majoring in Women's Studies and Criminal Justice and my ultimate goal is to be a detective. I love rock and country music, partying, going to the beach, tubing, dancing, driving 4-wheelers, reading, and shooting pool. I'm a bit of a chunker but still look damn good in a bikini, so if you don't like chubby chicks, then don't talk to me. And I don't mean that in a mean way, I'm just saying you'd be wasting both of our time.
