I am 21 and a senior, psychology major at Anderson University. I live and breathe music. It is my life and I have no clue what i would do with out it. I mainly listen to rock music and my fav band is Avenged Sevenfold. I love to play my guitar, go to awesome concerts and watch football and UFC. I am a huge San Diego Chargers fan and I even named my adorable puppy Diego after them lol.  I have a love affair with the city of San Diego; it is an amazing city and I want to move there one day.I love tattoos and I currently have two, but I am already planning my next one. Sons of Anarchy is currently my fav show and it is amazing. Purple Rain is one of my fav movies and I think Prince is a genius. I am okay with spending a quiet evening at home, but I also love getting all sexified and going out for drinks with friends. That is all I can think of to say, but if you want to know anything else, just ask : D
