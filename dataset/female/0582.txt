Moved to UT to be closer to family. Love horses, music, cooking, working out, motorcycles, outdoors, spending time w/family &amp; friends. I value honesty &amp; integrity. On here for fun &amp; to meet some new people. If you want to know more...just ask. If you're from Colorado &amp; I try to match it's because I'm there alot for drill &amp; my full-time job. :)
