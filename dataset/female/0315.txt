I like to keep things simple...I enjoy reading, hanging out (esp. with smaller groups of my friends, I admit i'm a little on the shy side), and am a devoted christian which holds a lot of importance for me. From others, I value honesty above all else, even it's brutal. Feel free to be a little blunt with me, because I appreciate that a lot.

My name is Allison or Ally, by the way. Call me either one. Also, if you're going to talk to me, please don't freak out if I don't respond every chance I can, I'm a tad busy. So I say it again, if I don't respond, no name-calling, no spamming the hell outta me with 100 messages, no making fun of my haircut, and be patient! lol. Pretty please?!
