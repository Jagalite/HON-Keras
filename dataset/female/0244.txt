5'3&quot; 130lbs Red hair, blue eyes. I have 2 kids. Although I have my moments I'm pretty laid-back. I can be a bit stubborn at times and I'm very opinionated, but also pretty open-minded. I hate the cold and I'm not a morning person. I'm scared to death of spiders. I'm always up for a night of drinking or just chillin with friends. I love living life as it comes at me, not regretting the past and not worrying about stuff I can't control. I'm not into playing games and I won't tolerate drama.
