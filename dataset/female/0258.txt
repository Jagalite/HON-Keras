I'm a real down to earth girl. I love fourwheeling, reading, singing, and driving just a little too fast down dirt roads. I hang out on myspace sometimes. I've been called smart, goofy, and sweet. I believe friendships come before relationships. I attend the University of Alabama. I'd be interested in a guy with a sense of humor, good standards, and respect for hard work.
