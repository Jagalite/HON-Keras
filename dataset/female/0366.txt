First of all; for some reason when i send a star member i message they dont get it, so leave me ur email addy in a message if u want to talk.

I am a 22 yr old college student studying sports medicine; after college I plan working as an athletic trainer. I have a 2yr old son named Kane. He is the only man in my life right now. 
 I am looking for a man not a boy; who has a good head on their shoulders and knows what they want in life and is willing to go and get it. I also look for men that are family oriented, likes kids, honest, romantic, respectful, out going, fun loving, and can be happy doing nothing as long as he is with the person he loves, and doesnt have to go out every weekend just to have a good time. 

 I am a die hard NOTRE DAME &amp; Colts football &amp; INDIANA basketball fan. I am the type of girl that can hang with the guys. 

Well......I think thats about it for now; so if u like what u see then please show some interest =)
