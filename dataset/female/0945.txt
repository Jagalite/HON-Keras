PLEASE READ. NYC woman wants to smart, witty, funny, confident SINGLE MEN 35+ WITHOUT KIDS for dating &amp; possible LTR. I'm not here for hookups. No bikers or men w/tattoos or piercings. If you're so superficial that you need to lift up your shirt and show your manly chest (lol), then I'm not interested. I RATE SHIRTLESS GUYS 1. If you're wearing sunglasses IN YOUR MAIN PIC to hide your eyes, then I'm not interested. I RATE GUYS IN SUNGLASSES 1. I won't jump through hoops to view your pic. I RATE GUYS W/ROTATED PICS 1. I don't want to see your car, niece, nephew or friend's kids, &amp; I certainly don't want to see your ex-wife or girlfriend! Wanna get my attention? Post a close-up photo OF YOURSELF &amp; list your interests in your keywords. If you've clicked &quot;Yes&quot; to meet me &amp; I don't make it a Double-Match, then I'm not interested. Don't bother clicking &quot;Yes&quot; again. Translation: Move on. Nothing to see here. OTOH, IF I MAKE IT A DOUBLE-MATCH, PLEASE E-MAIL ME OR I'LL DELETE YOU. I hate games.
