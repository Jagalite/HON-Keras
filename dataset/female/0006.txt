Hey, I'm Amee.  I'm in Arkansas for a few months for work.  I like to smile and see the positives in life.  Negativity is not an attractive trait.  When I'm not busy with work, I spend time with my family and friends, travel, and read.  I'm past the party stage, but I still know how/when to have a fun.  I have these things called morals and I  can be a little picky, but you know what?  I have a right to be.  I'm looking for someone who is educated and knows what he wants in life.  A man who is a go-getter.  I'm not a fan of people that can't spell or choose to talk improperly.  So, if your profile makes no sense (and it's supposed to) and it takes more effort than normally needed to read your messages...  Yeah, maybe this isn't the best place to look for someone like this, but hey...a girl can dream, right?
