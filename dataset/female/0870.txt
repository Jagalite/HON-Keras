A complicated individual with an even more complicated sense of style. A fascination with Japanese culture and fashion, mixed with a bizarre range of knowledge on the odd and controversial, i'm not one to shy away from an interesting and intellectual conversation. Narcissism and bloated egos are cultural downfalls. Ignorance and prejudice are condemnable sins. And aside from all that, i have a problematic Peter Pan complex that allows many to think i'm far more juvenile than i actually am...though i wouldn't change that little characteristic for the world.
