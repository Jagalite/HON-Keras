I'm a Medic with 10th Mtn Div.  I love swimming, and sunbathing, which, yes you can do this in the frigid north country.  However, it's only for about two or three months that it's warm enough to find me laid out on the sand.  In the winter, I'm reading infront of a fireplace. I love rock, metal, pop country.  Weekend nights find me at the bar dancing with my friends or at the movies.  Also, Not looking for someone to date, or sleep with.  Just looking for new friends to hang out with....
