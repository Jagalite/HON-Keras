Hey Hello, I'm a 28yr old divorcee, workalholic, proud mom of two.  I'm on here to meet new ppl or who knows I might find my rocker/cowboy Lol. I'm stubborn and have a strong personality I'm a reg person who's been hurt but keeps on going I'll not let anybody hold me back so if you want a loyal friend who'll tell you the truth then go ahead and chat with or become my friend online only a few will be my friends or maybe more offline. I'm a college student going for my AA in Culinary Arts. I love to watch movies or listen to music while I clean my house. I'm pretty much a laid back kind of person, not really liking to go out much lol all I do right now is school, and go home to my wonderful two kids who no one will see until I really know you, sorry but I'm very protective of them.
