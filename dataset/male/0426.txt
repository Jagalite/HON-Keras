My name is Isaac, im almost 20 and going to college. I dont know what i want to do in life yet but im trying to figure it out. I live in Lakewood, CO, I love Colorado and the mountains.  I love to watch and play all sports, especially basketball. I love to read, watch movies/tv, go hiking, swimming, Im just always down for a good time. I like to party a lot too. ;) Im tall, athletic, i have 5 tattoos and i love them. Im just on here trying to find someone that is honest and real, and if youre gorgeous too that doesnt hurt. Dont click yes if youre not willing to talk.
