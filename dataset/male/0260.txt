Whilst your couch potato fella is drinking cheap lager &amp; watching his team lose the fooball match, he is shouting at the telly, and you are nagging him from the kitchen to do the washing up, I am coring thermals 4,000ft above the Peak District. 

Independent, smart, passionate, interesting guy with a busy schedule (I may not answer quickly), high standard, low maintenance, risk-taker, ex-skydiver, PARAGLIDER. Driven, kind, thoughtful, &amp; self-aware. Rocker, &amp; DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE REST. Clumsy, lazy, forgetful &amp; HONEST, idealist, nice eyes, cute nose, cheeky smile &amp; even cheekier sense of humour to match (including about being here). 

I enjoy anything with adventure to anything chill out &amp; relaxing, be it spiraling down to the landing field after paragliding cross country, or just ralaxing walk around the lake just chilling &amp; taking in the culture, natural history &amp; wildlife of the place. (shhh don't tell anyone) .

If your hobbies include &quot;binge drinking, going round town&quot;, click NO!
