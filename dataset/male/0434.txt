I'm in the US Army, stationed at Fort Hood but from WI. I'm an adrenaline junkie but still haven't found the kind of rush that would leave me thinking, &quot;I'm never doing that again&quot;. I, like so many other people, have no idea what I want to do with my life. Message me if you feel like it. If not, good luck on your endeavors.
