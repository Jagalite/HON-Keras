So how do you describe yourself in words to someone you've never met?  I could say im wild, crazy and different... but wouldnt that make me just like everyone else on here?  I make movies with my friends and i love comedy.  Im moving to myrtle beach in a couple weeks and dont know anyone, who wants to be my friend???
