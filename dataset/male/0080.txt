My name is Seamus and I'm a positive, happy person. I like to laugh, keep things fun and light and I'm a bit of a joker who likes to tease. I'm big into the outdoors and love water sports - especially scuba diving, kayaking and swimming. My active personality keeps me outdoors and trying new things...so I'm looking for someone who shares a passion for the new, undiscovered and exhilarating life has to offer. I do like to kick back and relax too...but if it's a beautiful day, you may as well get out there and take full advantage of it...whether that's a walk thru the market, going for a run along the Canal or taking a day trip to Montreal.

Guilty pleasure: I like to give massages...but if you think you're getting one of the first date, think again. I'm not a hussy lol :)
