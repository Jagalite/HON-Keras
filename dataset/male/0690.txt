I love to hang out with friends and do outdoors stuff. I'm also sort of a gear head. I like cars, bikes, and 4 wheeling. I grew up on a ranch in western SD and like spending time on the ranch. I just started school at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City, going for a degree in Geological Engineering.
