I love cars, classic rock, film, animals, swimming, and boats. I'm ambitious in my career and I do not put up with bull****. I'd really like to meet a girl with whom I can share a mutual respect and set of interests with. 
Physically, I have blueish-grey eyes, short brown hair, near-perfect teeth.  Im 5ft11, quite thin but in shape and somewhat toned.  Average toned skin, not pale but not dark.  I would consider myself to be in between introverted and extroverted - I'm fairly outgoing at times but I definitely need my quiet time, as well.  I'm more of an observer than a talker.  I watch and listen before I decide what I'm going to say.  I also despise the feeling to talk about nothing.  This may sound a little harsh or prudish, but I also have a ridiculous and eccentric sense of humor and am actually a very nice, open-minded guy.
I'm on this site because I've been told that I'm very good-looking/handsome, but I often feel otherwise as I don't meet many girls who seem interested.
