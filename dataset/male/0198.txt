Well, I just got back from Iraq and I'm really happy to be back in the States!  Currently in the Military stationed at Ft. Lewis and hating every second of it!  LOL.  I have about 6 months left in the Military before I'm finished and I really can't wait for that day.  When I'm finished I am going to be moving to Hollywood, California to pursue my dream of acting, I'm also going to be going back to school for my Masters/Doctorate in Psyho Therapy which I'm really excited for as well.  Other than that I'm just biding my time in the military and looking forward to my future!  My life is an open book though, please feel free to ask me anything and I'll give you an honest answer!
