I take life one step at a time and rarely get upset over or worry about anything.  I'm the type of guy who always carries jumper cables, tools, and tow straps/chains in the truck and will help stranded motorists. I hate spending weekends idle, and I've been known to drive across whichever state I'm in spontaneously just to get out enjoy the drive. I love to drink and sample beers I've never had, random drives through the desert or mountains, swimming, movies, honesty, and lots of other things I can't think about right now.

I'm returning to Washington in a few weeks, been out of town for basically 4 years and can't wait to see what's changed or stayed the same.
