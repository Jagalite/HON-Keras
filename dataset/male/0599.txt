Make fun of me for the purple frame around the door if you wish. I deserve it. The worst thing about being a guy is having to shave your face every third day or so. Sometimes sooner, as the ladies dictate. I will now use this space to do some things that I can't do in real life. (Does a double black flip in one leap, with a tumbling roll and a dive into a 12 feet-deep pool). I don't take myself very seriously (usually), and neither should you! :-O Have fun!
