What am I looking for on here exactly? Good question. Friendship is a great place to start. Anything that develops from there is a bonus. I'm hoping to find someone that I really click with - honest, fun, caring, someone that doesn't need to go out all the time.

My background is Canadian / Italian and I'm a chef living in the Brampton area working in Vaughan (Maple, ON) at Ontario's biggest sports bar. I've been cooking for about 12 years and I absolutely love what I do. I have a real passion for food, whether it's preparing it, eating it or even just talking about it.

And speaking of talking, that's something else I really enjoy doing. I'm looking for someone I could have a deep philosophical talk or just talk about silly nonsense with. I'm a well spoken individual and my friends say that I'm pretty intel, um intelli, uhhh smart! lol

Family is VERY important to me as well as my friends.

I look forward to hearing from you all and please feel free to ask any questions. :)
