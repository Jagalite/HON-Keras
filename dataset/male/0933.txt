This World is beautiful. Its So amazing this thing we call life. think about it. we are not the only Intelligent life forms in the universe but the things we call Life....Emotions...Laughter...coffee...ceramic pottery...Art...you...me...Love...hate...war... that's what may be the things that sets us apart from everything else. NEVER take a Life for granted. no matter even if you've been pushed around, spit on, kicked, JUMPED, messed with in any way, even if you have virtually nothing...ALWAYS remember u still have life...My name is Tyler (ele, Elephant, E, E-Boy, Phunt, etc.) its from my old paintball team
