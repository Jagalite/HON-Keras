Moving to the Austin / Ft Hood area from San Diego and to be honest, I'm sure I'll be bored...Looking for a local tour guide to show me the ropes. Don't be shy now, I'm not. 

I'm a Captain in the Army...I have a custom chopper / motorcycle, I spend most of my time downtown in Austin, I love bars, going to Las Vegas, riding, live music and meeting interesting women. 

Please dont add me if your not going to chat....I'll just remove you!  I dont like wasting my time....and YES I am here to meet people, why are you here? NO, not for the ratings..dont lie LOL.

Anywho...hit me up, might be fun.
