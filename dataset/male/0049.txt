44, retired Air Force and work as a high-voltage electrician here on base. Married w/ 3 boys and live in Goldsboro. Ride a 1985 Harley and like to dirt bike off-road. Listen to classic rock, metal and country (depends on my mood). I like watching adventure/horror/sci-fi/comedy movies and read books about most anything. I enjoy a medium steak, a good cold lager, east Carolina bbq, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese or Korean. Jeans and casual shirts- no suits in my closet. I might own one tie, but haven't seen it for a while.
