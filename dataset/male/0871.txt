I'm 6'2&quot; and I was training for bodybuilding until I decided to join the Marines. I'm leaving sometime within the next 6 months for boot camp, after which I will be going God knows where to do what Marines do. I play the guitar for 16 years now and I'm kinda in a metal band but we never really practice lol. I enjoy working on my M3 as long as it's not fixing something I broke lol. I like to drink and party as much as the next guy and have an awsm group of friends who share this hobby :) I'm really quite shy until I get comfortable around new people and then I get kinda crazy and obnoxious lol. That's me in a nutshell!
