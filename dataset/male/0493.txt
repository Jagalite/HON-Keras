Never quite sure what to say about myself.  Its been years since I updated this.  I spend most of my time working as advanced tech support for a satellite tv company.  I have a regular zoo at the moment, though I'm trying to pare it down a little.  Currently I have 3 chinchillas, 2 dwarf hamsters, and a dog who is still half-puppy.  Aside from that, I have such a wide variety of interests, its hard to list them all.  Everything from football to golf, computer geek to going out with friends.  I'm somewhat of an oxymoron.  A socialized geek.  An extroverted introvert if you will.  I guess the biggest thing with me is that its usually not so much what I'm doing, but who I'm doing it with that makes me happy.  Good people make any experience better.  If you'd like to know more, feel free to ask.
