Ive been burned so bad, but I still play with fire.  Sometimes naked truth is what I don't believe in.  Is that the theme of an eternal optimist, or an insane person?  Is the difference any more than the end result?   I was born in '79 and am a truck driver.  That gives me a lot of time to think and make up my reality.  Believe it or not I don't meet to many single people in my travels, or if I do it is a one time meeting and I never get back.  So I am trying the online thing.  Have a great day and maybe talk to you later.
