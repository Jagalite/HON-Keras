Hi I'm Brandon and I live in The Netherlands. I enjoy having deep conversations with friends, and I am addicted to seeing movies. So are my friends, of course =). I'm currently studying philosophy in Utrecht, and I find it extremely interesting! Epicurus is my personal hero. If you feel the need to share your thoughts, or whatever, do not hesitate to send me a message!

Cheers!
