Currently I'm a student at Devry, taking networking administration.  I'm following that pursuit because I realized I have a knack for it and like doing it while in the Marine Corps.  I'm divorced and sticking to single for a little while.

I ride a motorcycle when I have time, ride my bicycle almost every other day, work out when I feel like it, play the drums whenever I can, and try to meet new people whenever I get the chance.  

I love grilling, but I tend to eat more salads than burgers.  I love the beach, animals, being outside, live stand-up, and honest people.  In contrast I'm not big into partying, I don't like smoke, and I rarely get drunk, but I do love going to a nice bar and hanging with friends.  I'm the kind of guy that people call when they need help, I'm dependable, full of humor, and I love to learn new things.
