Its hard to describe yourself on paper without lying to the crowd, and lying to yourself, or on the flip side, coming off too intensely.  I'm Andrew, a simple enough man, who follows a simple enough creed, pass it forward.  Its a Karma thing.  I'm a loner by nature, yet not alone, the sound of silence is just as appealing as all hands clapping.  I'm a beautiful fallible human being, both noble and cruel.  With equal parts Saint and Sadist, I am human.  I should put it out there, i'm both a soldier, and a manager for a adult entertainment firm.
