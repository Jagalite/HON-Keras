I'm picky when it comes to pizza and wings.  I like beer, cookies, and roller coasters... yes, all at the same time.  I'm from upstate NY and go to college in northern TX.  I plan on being rich enough to have boats in both states and probably a couple more.  People tell me I'm funny, but it usually takes them a few minutes to catch my jokes.
