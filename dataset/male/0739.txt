I work and teach digital effects for TV and film for a living. I like checking out live music, preferably rock and alternative, new great restaurants, snowboarding, playing guitar, jamming with friends, Etc...

I'm a pretty fun and easy going guy, I like drinks with friends, bringing people together. Making and achieving goals, helping others make and achieve theirs.

also i'm a devourer of tiny universes..om nom nom...
