yeah....so i'm kind of a big deal around here. why you ask? find out.  unsocial people need not apply. i live my life like it was my own. it is what it is. lust isn't love, but it's the starting point. but, remember bodies fade, but passion shouldn't. youtube josh thompson- way out here...if you don't like that tune, you won't like me.  i got my my toes in the water, toes in the sand, not a worry in the world, and a cold beer in my hand..life is good today..

ps...4 days from 9/15 until my profile is no longer. my attentions going to one girl, and if that don't work...maybe i'll be back one day.
