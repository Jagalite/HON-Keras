I am originally from New York area living in Los Angeles a few miles from the Pacific.  I have a friend who posted here and met some cool people so thought I would give it a try.  I am 38, 5'11, 220lbs, Italian American and enjoy hiking, biking, exploration, working out and exploring the city.  I am usually clean cut but have grown out the beard to see what it looks like.  I realize most women dislike facial hair but at this point in life am living to please myself first, then others.  I'm not really &quot;LA&quot; and more &quot;East Coast&quot; at heart.
