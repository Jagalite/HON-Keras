This is me right after my drunken bike wreck. I had to slow it down after that. I like doing pretty much anything that involves excitement. I like biking, camping, running, trying to get back in shape, I see that flab starting to show once again. Mostly I like the outdoors when its nice outside so if there is something to do outside I'm on it. I can also just kick back relax, watch a movie or whatever. My life goal as of right now is to be rich very rich although I don't believe it will make me happy I think it will make me happier, and life has less problems when your loaded. I love my family especially my 2 little twin brothers. I enjoy being around happy positive people, I can't stand someone that nags all day about nothing. Depressing people just drag you down. I always say find something you like make it work and stick with it. I'm usually laid back, easygoing, and just try to make the most out of what I'm given.
