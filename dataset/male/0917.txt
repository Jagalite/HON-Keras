Hi,

I'm Ed and I live in Kidderminster near Birmingham. I'm 29, 6ft 2&quot; tall, blue eyes and I guess you'd say an athletic build. I spend my days working as a Software Engineer but at weekends i'm a cyclist and love to race my bike. Spare time I like the usual stuff like outdoors, cinema, going out with friends and stuff. x
