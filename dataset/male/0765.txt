my perfect girl loves candle-lit dinners, long walks on the beach, and has more facial hair than i do (coolpoints for sideburns). also, she'd better have at least 6 kids by 9 different dads already. and on top of the multi-colored primer pickup truck she drives, i'd like to see a nice gun rack that's cocked and ready to rock. the trailer park she lives at better be in a good part of town or else i'm not visiting. she should be allergic to exercise, have stock in ben-n-jerry's, and swear like a sailor. and if she's not addicted to at least 5 illegal substances, i've already lost interest.

haha april fools ;)
