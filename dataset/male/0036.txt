I am a lover. Music has a language all it's own and I like to speak it.
What's life without passion and love...no life at all. That's why I have very much of both. I have much respect for people who aren't afraid to step outside the norm. I don't know what normal is defined as, but I don't think I fall in that category and that, my friends, is just fine with me.
