I am a professional living outside a small Northern California town.  I love good friends, good music, horseback and motorcycle riding, flying, volunteering &amp; playing with my dog. Practical, fun-loving, good listener. NS/ND, straight.  I'm looking for a witty, intellgent Christian woman who is willing to ride on the back of my Harley or ride her own motorcycle.
