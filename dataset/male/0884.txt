Information Technology business owner and part-time paramedic. Three, no four, college degrees. Looking for someone who continually surprises me, but rarely (if ever) scares me. Someone who is looking for a life-long, monogamous relationship/marriage. Someone who enjoys the inherit variety that life offers. (Must know how to tango/salsa, or be willing to learn.) I've never been married and don't have any children. I hold degrees in chemistry, computer science (Dual B.A.), computer and communication sciences (M.S.), and international finance (M.B.A.) I'm illiterate in 5 languages (including English, Spanish, German, and Russian), and grossly illiterate in several others, but I usually manage to successfully communicate with everyone that I try to... I also enjoy spending quality time in major urban, American cities, like NYC, Chicago., Boston, and San Francisco. Have gone through several passports. My real height is 5'9&quot;, but so many liars inflate their height... (or so i'm told)
