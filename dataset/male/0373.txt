A quick perusal of a couple websites shows 2.1 billion adherents to Christianity worldwide as of 2007, and a majority of the U.S. population also identifying with Christianity in some form or another. Does it strike anyone else as humorous, then, that we're on a site passing judgment of strangers based on photos? Matthew 7:1? Anyway, I'm not as interested in your rating of me as you might think, as I'm sure I am a solid &quot;5&quot;. Average looking, average intelligence, etc. Put differently, if you saw me in line at the store, you probably wouldn't look twice. If I click &quot;Yes&quot; to you, it's not necessarily because I think you're Hot. I'm not interested in sex, dating, or marriage. Besides, if we're looking for a mate on the web, we could do better than to browse here, no? Just do your best to try to be a friend - believe it or not, sometimes that's all a person wants. I'll try to do the same.
