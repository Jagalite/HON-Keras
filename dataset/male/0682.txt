My name is Pierre. No really, it is! Et, je parle bien le francais. I lived in southern France for part of my life, a time which I'll never forget! I had the opportunity to hike in the French Alps, swim in the Mediterranean, and explore the many towns along the French Riviera AKA La Cote d'Azur. I'm very adventuresome in nature. It must be my New England roots that are responsible. I was born and raised in the Connecticut countryside, but I went to school in upstate New York as well as Western Mass. I moved to Massachusetts in 2004 to pursue my dreams and a career in engineering.
 
I want to find someone who wants to have a good time and can carry on a decent conversation (beauty is nice, but it sure isn't everything you know?). She should be straightforward, honest, and outgoing. Oh, and you must have a good sense of humor as my personality is witty with a touch of sarcasm. If you're an extraordinary woman with a great sense of humor, then I would love to meet you in person!
