I studied computer animation in college and am currently a graphic designer for two t-shirt companies. Simplicity is the key to my happiness and being in the mountains camping or on the beach just taking in the beauty of the natural world around me. My family means the world to me and I love my three older sisters dearly. My life hasn't exactly been one of privileged and has been quite hard, but I don't let the past rule what the future holds. I have experienced the best and the epitome of the worst relationships have to offer, so trust is one issue I have worked the hardest on. I am an open book to those who are interested in getting to know me
