Yes I read your introduction. If you say you're not interested in men then I will add you just to annoy you. I know your game I just choose not to play it. My political ideals are based on a foundation of compromise. I feel like there's too many narrow minded sheep who are following the lead of false prophets instead of being leaders themselves. If you are among the sheep then we have nothing in common. You should just pursue your common everyday DBag. I'm from Clinton Township Michigan and my name is Dustin. I'm on other social networking sites as well. If we hit it off and you're Uber special then I would gladly travel to see you. I've got nothing tying me down here and would like to see the world.
