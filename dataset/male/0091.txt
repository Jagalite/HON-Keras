Not much to say here really.  Ive lived in the Springs for 3 years now and i'm stationed at Peterson AFB.  I enjoy anything from going out and partying with friends to laying back and watching a movie, if it's fun I can get into it.  Never been married and don't have any kids.  Just looking for people to talk to and/or spend time with (not necessarily romantic at all, but who knows)  I'm a very open person so just ask me anything if you wanna know.  Just to add something small here.. if you're going to add me, say 5 words, and then delete me without explaining anything, don't bother.  It's a bit strange.. lol
