I'm Shanon Greer &amp; I'm from Phoenix, Arizona, in Spring, TX now. I spent 6 years in the Army &amp; deployed to Iraq 2 times. I'm easygoing, laid back, like to have fun, like to kick back &amp; relax with friends &amp; family. I like to joke around &amp; have a good time whereever I'm at &amp; I like to make other people laugh. I'm the life of the party so to speak especially after having a few drinks. I'm a proud parent of a 6 year old daughter who is everything to me &amp; I love her with all my heart. I'm here for friends but I can't stand bs from anyone, immature punks, stuck up snobs, rude people, lazy people, bad spellers or grammar users, gossipers, liars, or those against the military or war. If you fall into any of these categories then don't waste your time or mine. I like to meet new people and make new friends but don't have time for drama. Look me up on fb, I'm on there a lot.
