&quot;So life for you has been less than kind/ Take a number and stand in line/ We've all been sorry and we've all been hurt/ But how we survive is what makes us who we are&quot; (Rise Against - Survive) - I am a survivor.  I am also a moderate adrenaline junkie. Death doesn't scare me, but some spiders do :P I don't take too much seriously because I think laughter is the best medicine.
