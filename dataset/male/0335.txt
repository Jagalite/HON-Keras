Musician, composer, photographer, wannabe writer/journalist w/plans to combine these to enlighten the masses to help fuel the revolution. I'm a creative, artsy, unique, eclectic, eccentric type; probably a lil crazy and adhd but I enjoy every minute of my insanity!
Hate corporations, factory farms, and the consumer-crazy-money-hungry-fast-food-n-brainwashed-by-TV attitude of a good portion of our nation. Love exercising(running, biking, weights), intelligent conversations, reading, driving round taking photos, playing music, being social when the mood strikes me, hanging out, etc., etc..
I'll be selling my house and going on the road, living out of my car n traveling wherever the wind takes me for an undetermined amount of time so I'm looking to meet some interesting people on the way, peace!
