I'm interested in all the typical guy things. I want to see the world and experience. I have a very soft spot for food and sleeping. I'm very ambitious. Laid back, but outgoing. Just graduated college in May. I'm interested in all kinds of girls, from shy and nerdy, to outgoing and preppy. I don't really have a set preference. 

Working out is a hobby I enjoy, but I believe a woman doesn't need to be a super athlete to be hot.

I'm also a big sucker for proper grammar- you would be surprised how hard this is to find these days.

Want to know more? Just ask, and I'll get back to you in a heartbeat.

Take it easy.
