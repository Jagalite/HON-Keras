I'm a career computer geek who loves to get into deep conversations about a wide variety of topics.  I lead an extremely sedentary lifestyle, and am most happy when spending quality time with either a partner or just a small group of good friends.  I enjoy listening to all types of music (music is music, and I don't care what 'genre' it is labeled as if I like what I hear!), love movies and games.  I've recently taken up drumming, and would love to hear from others that enjoy live music performances.
