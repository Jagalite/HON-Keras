My name's Kyle. I'm really chill and laid-back. I go to UVU studying to be a professional pilot, already have my private license. Not looking for anything serious, just someone to hang out with and have fun. If something else comes out of that, cool. If not, that's cool too. I absolutely LOVE to do just about anything outdoors! If you're the kinda girl who would actually enjoy a good hike, then we need to talk!
