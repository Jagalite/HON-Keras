Life is great and I want to share it with someone along the way. I'm a 28 year old dad who loves his job, his family, and his friends. I don't live an extravagant life but it's mine and I try make the most of it. The only thing that could make it better would be to have a wonderful woman to cap it off.

I'm an artist, I love music, and I love relaxed evenings with good company. A night on the town is always fun, though in moderation.
