Bi rugby player looking for friends and fun. Work in healthcare as well as the arts. Very spontaneous, laid-back, and love a good laugh. Enjoy anything outdoors, extreme sports, beer, anything artistic, and being on the water. 

Stats: 5'9&quot; 165lbs brown/brown 32w rugby build.

Dislikes: clothing and attitude

If I hit &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;Meet&quot; and you're straight; it's not because I wanna get in your pants. You're probably into rugby, music, or the arts; and I'd like to chat. Nothing more. Don't fret.
