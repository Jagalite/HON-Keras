First of all, I want to say that if I have poked you, I'm not trying to bother you, I'm just trying to encourage you to read my introduction carefully, becouse all the ladies I have Doublematched, almost for me, are worth enough to be got in touch :D

My name is Nacho Alonso Larré, I'm from Gijon, north of Spain. I'm studing telecomunications and information science in &quot;La universidad de Oviedo&quot;. I play rugby and football, actually I love any kind of activity that keep me on fit ;). I travel a lot around the world and hope to have the chance of spend at least one year studing in UCLA.

I love to meet new people from abroad, but I'm not a star member, so if you want to chat with me you are going to find another way. I use very often the facebook , so you can find me there. 

Thank you for have read till this point.
