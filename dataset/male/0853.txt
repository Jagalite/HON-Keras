I'm from Portsmouth, England, and I'm studying architecture in North Cyprus. I like playing sports and keeping fit at the gym. I'm a romantic and like to write poetry when I find the inspiration. I also like to make people laugh and smile and can be a total klutz, especially when I have butterflies in my stomach. I believe chivalry is not a lost notion. I hope I find someone who I can make smile everyday. I think this best describes me: &quot;An optimist is someone who falls off the Empire State building and after 50 floors says &quot;So far so good.&quot; But basically, I'm your average guy, if you're looking for above average, look up, maybe he'll fall from the sky, if not, say hi.
