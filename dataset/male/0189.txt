Hi Im Jason.  Im originally from Pittsburgh, PA.  I'm a HUGE Steelers fan.  I moved to Omaha 3 years ago for my job.  Its been a good time so far but it could always be better.  I'm not shy at all so fire away at me.  I like to go out and meet new people.  I'm in the Air Force so I work pretty hard but I play even harder. I really like to play basketball and raquetball and i'm pretty good at both, probably still can play basketball at the collegiate level.  Clubs, parties, and lounges are usually where you'll find me on the weekends.  I'm not big on pubs and bars though.  I'm willing to try and settle though and I do not mind staying in at all and cuddling.  Want to know anything else, just ask.
