I'm Edison.  I'm a senior at the University of Maryland working on two bachelor's degrees: Microbiology and Philosophy. I have the ambition of designing my own car, making movies, curing cancer, and making my own religion (although I'm currently in between practicing Deism and Zen Buddhism).  I love to smoke the good stuff and have good times whenever I can because you never know when you're going to go.  If you want to chat, hit me up.
