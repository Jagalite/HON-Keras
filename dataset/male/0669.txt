Hi, my name is Grant.  Not too much to say.  I have a two year old daughter that I adore.  Bought an old house earlier this year and have been living / working in it. Being old it has a ton of character.  I work for a natural gas drilling company where i do all the mapping among other things.  I drive a jeep and i love playing video games.  I'm a bit of a movie buff have well over a thousand movies lol.  I love the outdoors nothing i love more than to mow the lawn in the summer followed by a shower and a few beers.  I'm a smoker and have tried to stop several times and it seems its not for me.  I just enjoy it so much. Oh and for some odd reason i have two accounts trying to make them look the same lol
