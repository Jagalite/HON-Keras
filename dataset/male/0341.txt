Proud single father. My kids are my life. I've been in the military for 12 years. 8 more to go and I retire... I'm realy laid back and don't sweat the small stuff. I've been through alot the last few years and realy am content with just the kids and I. If your looking for a knight in shining armor to rescue you keep moving. I'm a no games, no drama, dead honest, uncompromising, cold hearted MF in dickies and tattoo's. Every woman I have ever trusted has cheated, so any thought I ever had of white picket fences and a normal family life is all but gone and I don't expect any female to ever be able to change my opinion of women,  or repair the trust issues that will never go away... but your welcome to try and prove me wrong... As of now, I Just want to live life to the fullest and enjoy each day. I have all I need in my two beautifull kids.
