I laugh often, I know who I am and I like me. I enjoy music of all genres. My car is not top of the line and new but I can fix it if it breaks. I am perfectly fine alone but it might be nice to have someone to share some days with. I'm a realist and a dreamer. I can do anything I set my mind to and I do it often :)

I'm looking for someone with character. I don't care how much your shoes cost or your purse. Other guys may trip over one another to be in your presence, but the reality is if your personality is as dense as a rock, we wont fit :p
