I'm a kid at heart, I am full of life, and love to laugh. I am fiercely loyal when in a relationship, I own a couple of small businesses and work from home.  I like going out, chilling and lounging on the couch, or getting out for just about anything exciting.  I can make plans months in advance, or just stop what I'm doing and change directions.  I'm an aspiring Photographer in the Atlanta and surrounding areas, and I'm always looking for new people to shoot in order to build my portfolio. 

Talk to you soon!
