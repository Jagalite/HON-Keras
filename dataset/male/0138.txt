Hey I'm a Las Vegas Native and am interested in meeting people who love life and don't take it for granted. I don't do clubs..don't gamble, at all...no drugs and no excessive drinking. I love to travel in the winter. Snowboarding is a big part of who I am. I have too many tattoos to count now and they all have a meaning to me. I pride myself on being real. I always hold my head up high and have a strong presense often mistaken for cockyness. I'm ready to settle down and have a family but am in no rush. I only want to marry once. That's how it should be. I don't judge and don't care what people think about me or how they view me. I have a mild o.c.d. because I like things clean and organized.I love to laugh and be laughed at. I'm a big jokester and kids love me. I love animals and would rather open a window than smash a fly but don't cross me because I won't hesitate to punch someones face in. I've come a long way from then to now. Meet me, you'll be glad you did.
