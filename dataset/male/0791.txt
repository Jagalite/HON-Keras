My name is Jason,  I love fishing, hunting, riding my quad, camping, nature photography, and spending time hanging by the campfire puttin a couple Yuenglings down with friends.  Big fan of MMA,  Anderson Silva is THE MAN!  

After being on here for awhile I have decided I need to make two statements.

#1.  I have a fiance, so I am not on here for any kind of hookup. 
#2.  I can't believe how many douchebags think it is &quot;totally rad&quot; to take photos of themselves standing in front of a mirror with their shirt off right after they finished rubbing baby oil all over their chest.... heres an idea... grow a pair and be a REAL man... tools!

P.S... IF I ACCEPT YOUR &quot;HALF MATCH&quot; AND YOU SIMPLY WANT TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN FRIENDS.... SEND ME A MESSAGE.... IF YOU DON'T,  I WILL DELETE YOU!!!
