Volunteer firefighter in northern VA.  I'm 38 and 6'2&quot;.  I have a wide variety of interests.  Work keeps me busy, but in my free time I listen to music, watch sporting events at a local bar, play video games, hang out at a park or whatever else pops into this crazy brain of mine.  I'm a really good cook.  I'm looking to meet new people in my area.
