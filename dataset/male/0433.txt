I'm a regular guy. I don't wear women's pants, straighten or dye my hair. I'm also not into Hollister or creatine. I prefer to get out and see the world. I like camping, martial arts, and generally being outside. I'm athletic, confident and reading this back to myself, a little arrogant. I'm looking for someone nice, smart, outspoken and carries herself well. Basically, no girls who fancy themselves as women. If you think you're up to it, send me a message. If not, please don't waste my time.
