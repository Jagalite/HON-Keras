I’m pretty random, very honest and extremely open-minded. Trying to find people who are interested in the same hobbies as me. I haven’t really been looking for a relationship lately, mostly just trying to get back on track. I’d really like to find a best friend. I have quite a few friends but I also have very nerdy/geeky hobbies that none of my friends are into so it would be nice to find someone I can relate to. I love to create things and really like to inspire and be inspired. Although it’s been awhile since I’ve had a muse.

I’m really easy going and simple to please. I’m more creatively ambitious than financially. I have a gift for technology, have a green thumb, enjoy cooking and could live in the water. I build and repair a lot of mechanical and technical equipment. I like to help people more than I like to help myself. Anything else, just feel free to ask.
