Ok i'm looking for a friend. I think frendship is the best way to start any kind of a relationship. If you start a relationship with sex and you don't have frendship it is easy to fail becasue you do not have the rock of a friendship to keep things solid. I want a best friend first then a lover not the other way around. I want someone that i really like to bring around my friends. Someone that does not get mad a the little things. I have a lot of good things about me and i have a lot of bad. I think the good out weighs the bad though. Not everyone is going to like me and im ok with that. I don't want everyone i just want one when it comes to a relationship. There is a lot to know about me and if you want to know just ask. Have a great day. john
