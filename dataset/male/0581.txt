I'm 25, I cuss, drink now &amp; then,  love my dog, my harley, &amp; guns (real guns not my arms people). I work hard, go after what I want, and live life my own way. Big into outdoor stuff and music, just a random side note old school rock and most music all sounds better on a record. If you want to know more than just ask I'll answer.
