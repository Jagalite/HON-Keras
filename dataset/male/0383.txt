My name is Chris. I'm 26 years old. 

I am a dynamic man, often seen scaling walls and leaping tall buildings. I've been known to remodel malls on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I write award-winning operas, and manage my time efficiently. Occasionally, it's not uncommon for me to tread water for three days in a row. I woo people with my sensuous and god like harp playing, and cook 30-minute brownies in 15. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my backyard. I enjoy urban hand gliding. On Wednesdays, after work, I repair electrical appliances free of charge. I am a abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. I perfected counting cards in Vegas. 

I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller #9 and have won the weekend passes. Yah, I rock.
