Hello, My name is Brandon, I'm on here just to have fun and meet people.  Sometimes it is fun to just talk, and then your realize that everyone says the exact same thing: &quot;I don't like drama, don't like cheaters/liars, I want respect...&quot;  at some point ladies, don't you have to hold yourselves accountable?  A liar, by definition, probably won't be honest enough to tell you when he/she's lying.  Get it?  If you have trouble discerning who is a d-bag, perhaps I can help.  There are signs, oh yes, there are symptoms of d-baggery that can be easily identified.  *disclaimer: if anything I say here offends you, your expectations are way to high.
