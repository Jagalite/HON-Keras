I'm 1/2 Puerto Rican and 1/2 Cajun French, originally from Lafayette, La.. I love music and sports. I was a music ed. major and play the alto &amp; tenor sax as well as playing softball &amp; baseball. I was in a 13 year relationship, just starting to date again and making new friends. And yes, I have 3 little ones and not much of a social life, but I'm very passionate and I do find time for fun with the right person.
