Hi there;

I'm Ethan. I really want to know what you think of me....I used to be quite good looking when I was younger...and now??? Well YOU let me know...

I am 174 lbs, 5'10, blue eyes, brown hair with some grey. Love to dine in  fine restaurants and enjoy good...no great movies. I also love travelling. I am a simple but very ambitious man with a great sense of humor. I have a university degree in finance and an MBA. The simplest and basic things in life are the most crucial to our happiness...hey I just came up with that now !!! not too bad - sometimes I actually impress myself like now LOL!!!
