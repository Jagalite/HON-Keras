Hi, my name is Tim. I am a 20 year old student from Long Beach California. My main obsessions in life are sports, art, and video games. I love all kinds of music, mainly metal and punk, but I also like music with elements of classical. I consider myself to be somewhat of an unusual guy, I'm not always for going with the crowd, and I am not someone who has any desire of getting &quot;wasted&quot; to have fun. Call me strait edge but I am no vegetarian. My favorite food is sushi and like most south cali boys I love my In-N-Out Burgers.
