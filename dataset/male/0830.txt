I'm trying to see what's out there. I'm a substitute teacher in Oakland, trying to get myself into grad school. Before grad school, I'm studying for a test to work the California public utilities commission. I played soccer for 13 years, I coached and did gymnastics for about 5 years. It would be nice if one of you bought the membership and made contact with me, cause I've bought the membership several times in the past, so now it's your turn. Drop me a line, say hi. Se habla espanol. Deveras, mis papas son de Mexico :-) Find me in the sky.
